- Implements file-based routing for both `/city/[id]` and `/crypto/[id]`.

### Tailwind CSS
- Highly customizable and utility-first.
- Used for rapid prototyping and fine-grained control over design.

### TypeScript
- Static type checking ensures fewer runtime errors and better developer experience.

### Shadcn/UI
- Provides modular, accessible, and themeable components out of the box.
- Ensures design consistency across all screens.

### PNPM over NPM/Yarn
- Faster installations and better workspace management.
- Ensures dependency locking with `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
